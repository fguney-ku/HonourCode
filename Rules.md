1.	Please read the honour code and type your name below.

2.	While there may be a lot of reading to do on a problem, there is relatively little code to write, so please take the time to read each problem carefully.

3.	Note that any functions or code fragments that you write will be judged not only on correct functionality, but also on clarity and good programming practice.

4.	Please mute yourselves. Talking, messaging, sharing screen are not allowed. 

5.	No questions to the TAs! Please raise your hand virtually and you will be directed to a breakout room with the instructor.

6. You will have (30x4+45) minutes, meaning 30 minutes for the first 4 questions and 45 minutes for the last question. 

7. You will receive an email from us with the link to accept the assignment every half an hour. Please check your email when we notify you on zoom and start working on the question. Do not forget to commit and push your repl. It is your responsibility to commit **before the deadline**. Late commits will not be accepted.

Good luck!
